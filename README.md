# AI Offer Assistant

This repository contains a **personal portfolio proof-of-concept** of an AI-powered assistant that helps teams prepare technical offers faster and more accurately.  
It’s inspired by real workflows in the **energy storage sector**, but **uses only synthetic or public data**.

> **Disclaimer**  
> This project is a personal portfolio demo.  
> It does **not** include any confidential, proprietary or internal data from any company.  
> A separate, local-only demo folder is used for on-site presentations (excluded from Git).

## Goals
- Reduce offer preparation time from ~45 minutes to a few minutes.
