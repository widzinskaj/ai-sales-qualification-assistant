# Wireless Communication Module for BESS – Variant A

## Overview
A compact communication unit designed to integrate battery storage systems
with power conversion devices. The module enables data exchange between
battery packs and the inverter, simplifying system integration and reducing
wiring complexity.

## Key Parameters (Synthetic)
- Supply Voltage: ~12–48 V DC
- Communication Interfaces: Wireless (battery side), Wired fieldbus (inverter side)
- Supported Data: SOC, voltage, current limits, system status
- Wireless Range: ~3–5 m
- Data Latency: <50 ms
- Operating Temperature Range: -10°C to +50°C

## Modularity
- Designed as a standalone communication module
- Can support multiple battery units within one system
- Typical installations range from small residential to light commercial setups

## Typical Use Cases
- Modular battery energy storage systems
- Hybrid PV + storage installations
- Systems requiring reduced cabling between batteries and inverter
- Retrofit and upgrade of existing storage solutions

## Notes
All parameters are synthetic and for demonstration purposes only.
